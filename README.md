### Participation in JPMorgan's CodeforGood - Education is Freedom (EIF) Challenge
Created a web application to help EIF match companies with their Mayor Intern Fellows applicant interns.

Utilized **Python, Flask, Javascript, Typescript, HTML/CSS, and Angular** technologies and frameworks to implement several tasks 
including data parsing, server connection, processing data, and displaying final output onto a site.

At its current state, there are four, disconnected parts to this app: 
  The first is the client and server communication, where the user can use the client UI to upload two CSV    datasets to the server. 
  The second involves parsing the input dataset to be used in the generalized Gale-shapely algorithm. 
  The third involves processing the datasets to produce (semi-) stable matchings of company/position and student. 
  The final part involved passing the resulting matchings to the client and presenting it as a formatted chart. 
  An extra addition was made to the project which introduced an Angular front-end to various parts of the web application.
