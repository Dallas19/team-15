### Participation in JPMorgan's CodeforGood - Education is Freedom (EIF) Challenge
Created a web application to help EIF match companies with their Mayor Intern Fellows applicant interns.

Utilized **Python, Flask, Javascript, Typescript, HTML/CSS, and Angular** technologies and frameworks to implement several tasks including data parsing, server connection, processing data, and displaying final output onto a site.

At its current state, there are five parts to this application: 
  1. **Client and server communication**: the user can use the client UI to upload two CSV datasets to the server. 
  2. **Parsing the input dataset** to be used in the generalized Gale-shapely algorithm. 
  3. **Processing the datasets** to produce (semi-) stable matchings of company/position and student. 
  4. Passing the resulting matchings to the client and **presenting it as a formatted chart.** 
  5. An extra addition was made to the project which introduced an **Angular front-end** to various parts of the web application.
